<h3>Fundamentals of Scratch</h3>
<p>This course teaches students programmatic thinking and game design in Scratch for beginners through the Fundamentals of Scratch curriculum. <br>Students who have graduated from this curriculum will be working in the game framework Pico-8. <br>Scratch is a block-based coding system designed by MIT, which allows students to learn software engineering concepts through creative coding and game design. We will make games, creative projects, and learn lessons on variables, loops, UI/UX, and functions. <br>Students will move sprites make music, create game loops, and build complex systems of art and play. Pico-8 is a game system made for advanced students to learn software engineering, game design, through the use of Lua code, music trackers, and sprite sheets. Students in this part of class will learn variables, loops, functions, and game states. Moving sprites, composing music/sfx, designing creative coding scenarios, and building games are all activities they can look forward to, and enjoy.<br> Students will be required to use a mouse and keyboard, typical of 20th century PC computers. The ability to listen, type on a keyboard, solve problems, and have fun is required for this class.By the end of the semester, students will have a portfolio of Scratch and/or Pico-8 games.
